General Architecture:
    2 job types, SaveBedtimesJob and ToggleInternetJob. From the UI, users can set a bedtime schedule, which propagates
    to file on delay. On propagation, if there is a cutoff time for today, spawn a job based on it. Allow cancellation
    of SaveBedtimesJobs on the normal system. ToggleInternetJobs however should not be cancellable, except through
    setting a null cutoff time for the day and having that updated value propagate before the current ToggleInternetJob
    runs, if extant.

    ToggleInternetJob should store a LocalDateTime such that if the computer is slept or turned off until the next day,
    the job will do nothing on run.

    Internet will be enabled on startup and on ping, provided the current time is after 5 AM and before any cutoff time
    for the day. If the cutoff time for the day is null, internet will be enabled after 5 AM.
