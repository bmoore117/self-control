docker run -d -p 4444:4444 --shm-size=2g --restart always selenium/standalone-chrome:latest
it's fine to use shm-size, as ultimately this shm lives in the linux vm that containers run in. So it should work

non-admin users should not be in the docker-users group. To ensure docker startup, as ben-local > task scheduler >
create task (not basic task) > run as ben local, do not store password, run whether logged in or not, run on startup,
launch C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe

next copy winsw.exe and winsw.xml to the user folder you have created, preferably ben-local.

.\winsw.exe install

Upgrade to new Edge from store, block using following steps:
Start -> Local Security Policy -> Software Restriction Policies -> Right click additional rules -> browse ->
select C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe

This should be good enough, as edge lives in program files and can't be modified by you while adminless

Task Scheduler -> Run as admin -> New Task (not new basic task) -> triggers -> on unlock of any user -> actions -> run
ping.ps1 from app-extracted directory of ben-local -> conditions -> run even when on battery.
